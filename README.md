🥤 Vending Machine Management System in C
A console-based vending machine simulation developed in C for our 3rd-semester Data Structures coursework. This project showcases the practical application of arrays for managing inventory, transactions, and a simple payment system.

Submitted: June–July 2024

🔧 Key Features
The system is divided into two main operational modes: Owner and Customer.

🛠️ Owner Operations
Add New Items: Introduce new drinks to the vending machine's inventory, limited by a MAX_ITEMS constant.

Restock Inventory: Easily replenish the stock of any drink item.

View Inventory: Display a complete list of all items, their prices, and current stock levels.

Track Earnings: Monitor the total revenue generated from all sales.

🎯 Customer Operations
Browse Products: View a clean, up-to-date menu of available drinks with their prices.

Purchase Drinks: Select one or more items to purchase in a single transaction.

Handle Payments: The system accepts payment and accurately calculates and returns the correct change.

Simulated Change: Provides a breakdown of the change returned in simulated coin denominations.

💡 Technical Details
This project was built from the ground up to demonstrate core programming principles.

Language: C

Core Concepts Applied:

Data Structures: Logic is built entirely on arrays for data management.

Modular Design: Organized with distinct functions for each operation (e.g., displayMenu(), purchaseItem(), restock()).

Control Flow: Utilizes loops and conditionals for menu navigation and decision-making.

Input Validation: Ensures the program can handle invalid user inputs gracefully.
